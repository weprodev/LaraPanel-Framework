# LaraPanel Framework

LaraPanel Framework is made by [Laravel](laravel.com) and [LaraPanel](https://github.com/weprodev/LaraPanel) package. We will be adding more functionality to this framework to improve development efficiency and make life easier.

# How To Install
Follow the below steps to install it.
```
1. composer create-project weprodev/larapanel-framework
2. Config your .env file or just use sqlite locally
3. php artisan migrate
4. php artisan db:seed
5. php artisan serve
```
 and then open the URL: [LaraPanel Admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/lp-admin/sign-in)
